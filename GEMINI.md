# GEOMETOR Divine

A Python library for analyzing `geometor.model` constructions to identify golden sections, harmonic ranges, and other geometric relationships.

## Key Modules (`src/geometor/divine/`)

-   **`divine.py`**: Main module for analysis functions.
-   **`golden/chains.py`**: Finds chains of connected golden sections.
-   **`golden/groups.py`**: Groups golden sections by various criteria (size, segments, points).
-   **`golden/ranges.py`**: Analyzes harmonic ranges within lines.

## Development Plan

See `ROADMAP.md`.
