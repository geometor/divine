"""
Golden Chain Analyzer: Harmonic Range Identification in Golden Sections

This module is designed to analyze and explore chains of connected golden 
sections, unraveling the harmonic ranges within geometric structures. 
Utilizing sophisticated mathematical analysis and geometric algorithms, 
it aims to identify, categorize, and unpack chains, providing an intuitive 
understanding of their intrinsic geometric harmonies.

Features:
  
- `find_chains_in_sections`: A function designed to meticulously identify 
  chains within a collection of sections, resulting in a hierarchical tree 
  structure representing connected sections.
  
- `unpack_chains`: Unveils the chains hidden within the tree structure, 
  outputting a list of individual `Chain` objects ready for analysis.

Each chainâ€™s flow is characterized by the comparative lengths of consecutive
segments, represented symbolically to understand the progression and 
transitions in segment lengths. Furthermore, this module empowers users to 
explore symmetry lines within chains, unveiling a subtle, profound aspect of 
geometric harmony.
