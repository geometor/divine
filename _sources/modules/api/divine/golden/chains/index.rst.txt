   Golden Chain Analyzer: Harmonic Range Identification in Golden Sections

   This module is designed to analyze and explore chains of connected golden 
   sections, unraveling the harmonic ranges within geometric structures. 
   Utilizing sophisticated mathematical analysis and geometric algorithms, 
   it aims to identify, categorize, and unpack chains, providing an intuitive 
   understanding of their intrinsic geometric harmonies.

   Features:
     
   - `find_chains_in_sections`: A function designed to meticulously identify 
     chains within a collection of sections, resulting in a hierarchical tree 
     structure representing connected sections.
     
   - `unpack_chains`: Unveils the chains hidden within the tree structure, 
     outputting a list of individual `Chain` objects ready for analysis.

   Each chain’s flow is characterized by the comparative lengths of consecutive
   segments, represented symbolically to understand the progression and 
   transitions in segment lengths. Furthermore, this module empowers users to 
   explore symmetry lines within chains, unveiling a subtle, profound aspect of 
   geometric harmony.

.. py:function:: find_chains_in_sections(sections: list[geometor.model.Section]) -> dict

   Identify chains of connected golden sections to form harmonic ranges.

   parameters:
       ``sections`` : :class:`list[Section]`
           A list of Section objects representing golden sections to be analyzed.

   returns:
       :class:`dict`
           A dictionary representing a tree structure where each node is a
           Section and connected Sections are child nodes.


.. py:function:: unpack_chains(tree: dict) -> list[geometor.model.Chain]

   Unpack the chain tree into a list of individual Chain objects.

   parameters:
       ``tree`` : :class:`dict`
           A dictionary representing a tree structure where each node is a
           Section and connected Sections are child nodes.

   returns:
       :class:`list[Chain]`
           A list containing Chain objects, each representing a chain
           of connected golden sections.
