- :doc:`geometor.divine`

  Dedicated to the exploration and analysis of the golden ratio in geometry, `geometor.divine` offers a suite of tools for discovering and understanding this fundamental proportion in various geometric constructions.

  The module comprises several submodules, each focusing on a unique aspect of golden ratio analysis, together forming a complete toolkit for in-depth exploration of its presence in geometric structures.

- :doc:`geometor.divine.golden`

  This submodule lies at the heart of the project, focusing on finding and analyzing golden sections in geometric models. It provides functions to identify golden sections in lines, points, and interconnected structures, facilitating comprehensive analysis of the golden ratio.

- :doc:`geometor.divine.golden.chains`

  Specializing in the analysis of chains of connected golden sections, this submodule uncovers harmonic ranges and patterns within geometric models, offering insights into the sequential and relational aspects of golden sections.

- :doc:`geometor.divine.golden.groups`

  Focused on grouping and categorizing golden sections, this submodule allows for sorting and analyzing golden sections based on various criteria such as size, segments, and points, enhancing the understanding of their distribution and relationships within geometric constructions.

- :doc:`geometor.divine.golden.ranges`

  This submodule is dedicated to analyzing harmonic ranges and proportions within geometric models, particularly examining the relationships and ratios that define the golden ratio in various geometric contexts.
