A Python library for analyzing geometor.model constructions.

Overview
--------

The `divine` library provides tools to identify golden sections, harmonic ranges, and other geometric relationships within a `geometor.model` construction. It is used by the Explorer to provide real-time analysis.

Key Features
------------

- **Golden Section Analysis:** Identifies points that divide segments into the golden ratio.
- **Harmonic Range Analysis:** Analyzes harmonic ranges within lines.
- **Chain and Group Analysis:** Finds chains of connected golden sections and groups them by various criteria.

Key Files
---------

-   `divine.py`: Main module containing the core analysis functions.
-   `golden/`: A sub-package for finding and analyzing golden sections.
-   `events.py`: Manages the event handling for analysis updates.

Usage
-----

The `divine` library is typically used in conjunction with `geometor.model` and `geometor.explorer`. The `explorer` application automatically calls the `divine` analysis functions when a model is updated.
